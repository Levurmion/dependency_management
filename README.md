# About

This repo contains prototypes of the `JSONDocumentManager` and `ComputationalGraph` systems.

## JSONDocumnentManager

This module provides a scalable way to build SQL-like cascade relationships between inter-dependent JSON documents.

## ComputationalGraph

This module provides a pattern for defining a chain of mathematical calculations where the changes made to one variable can be propagated automatically
to satisfy the entire equation.
